IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Shared Memory Implementation:
   - Created a consistent shared memory key in a shared header file (shared.h)
   - Ensured both oss and worker processes access the same shared memory segment
   - Improved error handling for shared memory operations

2. Command Line Arguments:
   - Added proper argument parsing using getopt() for all required parameters:
     * -n (total number of processes)
     * -s (simultaneous processes)
     * -t (time limit for children)
     * -i (interval between launches)
   - Added validation to ensure all arguments are positive
   - Implemented a help message with -h flag

3. Worker Termination Logic:
   - Fixed calculation of termination time by properly adding the wait time to the current clock
   - Normalized termination time calculation when nanoseconds exceed 1 second
   - Reduced polling interval to ensure workers don't miss clock changes
   - Implemented proper startup, periodic, and termination messaging

4. Process Management:
   - Improved tracking of active and total children
   - Implemented proper reuse of process table entries
   - Added interval-based process launching that respects the simulated clock
   - Fixed the checkForTerminatedChild() function to correctly update the process table

5. Signal Handling:
   - Added handlers for SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGTERM signals
   - Implemented the required 60-second timeout using SIGALRM
   - Added a cleanup function to properly terminate all child processes and remove shared memory

6. Clock Management:
   - Improved the incrementClock() function to ensure consistent behavior
   - Added a mechanism to print the process table at regular intervals of simulated time
   - Modified the clock checking logic in workers to ensure they detect changes

7. Random Time Generation:
   - Fixed the random number generation to ensure each worker gets a different runtime
   - Added better seeding using a combination of time, PID, and process count
   - Implemented the required randomization between 1 and timeLimit seconds

8. Makefile Improvements:
   - Fixed the Makefile to correctly compile both executables
   - Added proper dependency handling for the shared header file
   - Included a 'rebuild' target for cleaner recompilation
